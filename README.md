Odin Project 1 

Welcome to my first Odin Project! I'm hoping to show some of the skills that I have learnt so far. 
I'll successfully create a basic website using HTML. The website will be a recipe website. The website will be written within VS Code, and will use elements such as the HTML boilerplate, headings, paragraphs, emphasis and strong. I will also include images and alt attributes, and the website will contain absolute and relative links.
